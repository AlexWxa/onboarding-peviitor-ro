Hello there,

I am Sipos Romeo, and last year I decided to change my carrer trajectory. I completed a Manual testing course from GoIT so far and have familiarized myself with automation testing by creating a few small projects using Selenium.
I the future I would like to prepare and obtain the ISTQB Foundation level certification and expand my knowledge regarding testing.

### My skills:
Selenium, C#, Python, Java

### My expectations:
Become part of the community and learn as much as I can along the way.
