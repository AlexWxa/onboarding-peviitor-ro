I am a junior web developer with almost one year of hands-on experience in building responsive and user-friendly websites.
My skills include HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and React.js, which Iâ€™ve used to create clean, efficient, and dynamic web applications.
Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my knowledge in advanced React concepts, state management tools like Redux, and explore modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. I also aim to deepen my understanding of UI/UX design principles to enhance my front-end development skills.
